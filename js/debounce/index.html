<!-- Debouncing is a mechanism by which we can reduce the number of call to a function  
     This call will be executed when the difference b/w two concurrent events is greater than the given time 
     
     In simple terms, Wait for a period of inactivity, then run the function.

     Analogy
        Imagine you're taking a photo:

        Action	    Analogy
        Debounce	Wait until the person stops moving, then click.
        Throttle	Take a photo every 2 seconds no matter what.
